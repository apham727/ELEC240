\section{Objective}

The objective of this lab was to learn the underlying logical operations behind an adder and to then apply these principles to implement a one-bit full adder on a breadboard.

\section{Test Description}

In the first section of the lab, we learned about the logic underlying the fundamental NAND and XOR gates and their truth tables for all combinations of inputs. We then formulated an expression for the correct output of the adder for the three input bits. We then applied DeMorgan's law to simplify the circuit so that it only uses NAND and XOR gates, and we then constructed the one-bit full adder.

\subsection{Pre-Lab Calculations and Schematics}
To begin, we had to understand the underlying logic behind a NAND and a XOR gate, which the adder was composed of. Below in Figure \ref{NAND} is the truth table for a NAND gate, and in Figure \ref{XOR} is the truth table for a XOR gate.

			\hline
			A & B &  A NAND B\\ [0.5ex] 
			\hline\hline
			0 & 0 & 1\\ 
			0 & 1 & 1\\
			1 & 0 & 1\\
			1 & 1 & 0\\ [1ex] 
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}

\end{figure}

			\hline\hline
			0 & 0 & 0\\ 
			0 & 1 & 1\\
			1 & 0 & 1\\

			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
	\caption{XOR Truth Table}
	\label{XOR}
\end{figure}

We then derived the following expression for the Sum $S$ and Carry $C$ output bits of the adder based on the three one-bit inputs $x,y,z$. 

$$ S = (x \bigoplus y) \bigoplus z$$
$$ C = (x \bullet y) \vee (x \bigoplus y) \bullet z $$

We then created the following truth table for the sum and carry bits based on these outputs as follows in Fig \ref{sum}:

\begin{figure} [H]
	\begin{table}[H]
		\centering
		\begin{tabular}{||c c c c c c c c c||} 
			\hline
			x & y &  z & $x \bullet y$ & $x \bigoplus y$ & $(x \bigoplus y) \bigoplus z$ & $ (x \bullet y) \vee (x \bigoplus y) $ & C & S\\ [0.5ex] 
			\hline\hline
			0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\ 
			0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
			0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1\\
			0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0\\
			1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1\\
			1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0\\
			1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
			1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1\\[1ex] 
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
	\caption{Naive Truth Table for the Sum and Carry bits}
	\label{sum}
\end{figure}

However, the direct implementation of the above truth table into logic requires the use of 2 XOR gates for the sum bit 2 NAND gates, and 1 OR gate for the carry bit. Since we want to reduce the complexity of our adder, we can use DeMorgan's laws to simplify the requirements for the carry bits:

$$ x \bullet y = \lnot (x \vee y) $$
$$ x \vee y = \lnot (x \bullet y) $$

We then obtain the following equation for the carry bit expression by applying the above DeMorgan's laws:

$$ C = \lnot 
\left( 
\lnot (x \bullet y) \bullet \lnot 
\left( 
\left(x \bigoplus y \right) \bullet z 
\right) 
\right) $$

The truth table is depicted below in Fig \ref{mod};

	\begin{table}[H]
		\centering
		\begin{tabular}{||c c c c c c c c||} 
			\hline
			x & y &  z & $x \bullet y$ & $x \bigoplus y$ & $\lnot ((x \bigoplus y) \bullet z)$ & $ \lnot(x \bullet y) \bullet \lnot ((x \bigoplus y) \bullet z)$ & C\\ [0.5ex] 
			\hline\hline
			0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0\\ 
			0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0\\
			0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0\\
			0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
