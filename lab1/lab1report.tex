	\section{Objective}
	
	This lab focuses on the fundamental tools and skills for electrical engineering laboratory work. This includes making current, voltage, and resistance measurements with a digital multimeter, creating graphs in MATLAB, and producing and measuring sinusoids with an oscilloscope and function generator. 
	
	\medskip
	
	%\textit{Note (To be deleted): Think of this test report as a document with your peers as your readers. This means you can assume a similar knowledge background as you. Your readers should be able to easily understand what is going on, and also be able to repeat your lab results based on your document and all references you cite.}
	
	%\textit{For the Objective section, identify the test you performed and its objectives. The objectives of the test are important to state because they are usually analyzed in the conclusion to determine whether the test succeeded.}

	\section{Test Description}
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Measuring Voltage with the DMM} We measured the voltage of the battery alone and then the voltage of the lightbulb when connected in series with the battey. 
		\item \textbf{Measuring Current With DMM} We measured current of the circuit with the lightbulb by putting the DMM in series with the lightbulb. 
		\item \textbf{Measuring Resistance with the DMM} We measured the resistance of various individual resistors (ie 330, 430, and 220 Ohms) and then measured the consistency of 10 460 Ohm resistors. 
		\item \textbf{Measuring the I-V Characteristics of a Light Bulb} We connected the lightbulb to the DC power supply from the VirtualBench so we could vary the input voltage. We then took voltage and current measurements as we increased the voltage and noted the discrepancies between the Power Supply output readings and our own measurements of voltage and current. 
		\item \textbf{Viewing Signals with the Oscilloscope} We created a 1kHz sine wave with the function generator then observed this sine wave with the oscilloscope. We observed the effects of changing the Time/Div and other positioning controls. 
		\item \textbf{Making Quantitative Measurements with the Oscilloscope} We used the oscilloscope to measure the DC power supply, a sine wave, and a square wave. We took measurements of frequency and amplitude of the sine and square wave. 
		\item \textbf{Testing Breadboard} Used a DMM to ensure that the breadboard had functional connections between important ports

You may want to number your equations/figures so you can refer to them in later sections. Including photos of handwritten work is okay.}

	\section{Conclusion}
	
	
	
	\medskip
	
	%textit{Note (To be deleted): While the ``Results and Discussion'' section focused on the test results individually, the ``Conclusion'' discusses the results in the context of the entire experiment. Usually, the objectives given in the ``Introduction'' are reviewed to determine whether the experiment succeeded. If the objectives were not met, you should analyze why the results were not as predicted.}
