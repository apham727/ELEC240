\section{Objective}

Your text here

\medskip

\textit{Note (To be deleted): Think of this test report as a document with your peers as your readers. This means you can assume a similar knowledge background as you. Your readers should be able to easily understand what is going on, and also be able to repeat your lab results based on your document and all references you cite.}

\textit{For the Objective section, identify the test you performed and its objectives. The objectives of the test are important to state because they are usually analyzed in the conclusion to determine whether the test succeeded.}

\section{Materials}

Your text here

\medskip

\textit{Note (To be deleted): Provide a bullet point list of components, software tools, and hardware (such as the NI VirtualBench or DMM) used during the lab}

\section{Test Description}

Your text here

\medskip

\textit{Note (To be deleted): This section provides a summary of the test your team performed. Give enough information so readers can understand what you did, but do not go into the details of every step.}

\subsection{Pre-Lab Calculations and Schematics}

Your text here

\medskip

\textit{Note (To be deleted): Include the homework pre-calculations and schematics that serve as the initial setup for the test. Briefly explain the importance of each item you include. You may want to number your equations/figures so you can refer to them in later sections. Including photos of handwritten work is okay.}

\section{Results and Discussion}

Your text here

\medskip

\textit{Note (To be deleted): The heart of your report is the presentation of your results and a discussion of those results. In your discussion, you should not only analyze your results, but also discuss the implications of those results.}

\section{References}

Your text here

\medskip

\textit{Note (To be deleted): List any datasheets, websites, lab procedure, etc. used during the lab.}

\section{Conclusion}

Your text here

\medskip

\textit{Note (To be deleted): While the ``Results and Discussion'' section focused on the test results individually, the ``Conclusion'' discusses the results in the context of the entire experiment. Usually, the objectives given in the ``Introduction'' are reviewed to determine whether the experiment succeeded. If the objectives were not met, you should analyze why the results were not as predicted.}

\section{Errors}

Your text here

\medskip

\textit{Note (To be deleted): Briefly list sources of error and discuss how to eliminate or deal with them}
