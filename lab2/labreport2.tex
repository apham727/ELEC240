\section{Objective}

In this lab, we explored how to detect and change signals through the use of electroacoustic transducers. In the first section, we observed the various properties of a signal such as its frequency and amplitude through a speaker and calculated how measuring this signal with the speaker affects the circuit. In the second section, we now produced signals through various methods like our vocal cords and the lab PC and viewed these signal properties on the oscilloscope. Finally, in section three, we independently viewed the signal properties of a photodiode and a light-emitting diode, then combined the two to view how a light-emitting diode can send signals to a photoresistor to achieve optoelectronic communication.

Your readers should be able to easily understand what is going on, and also be able to repeat your lab results based on your document and all references you cite.}



%\textit{For the Objective section, identify the test you performed and its objectives. The objectives of the test are important to state because they are usually analyzed in the conclusion to determine whether the test succeeded.}

\section{Test Description}

\subsection{Electroacoustic Transducers I}
We began by creating a 1kHz sine wave, connecting this signal to a speaker, and listening to the signal in audio form. We then varied the parameters of the input signal to listen to the effects on the output signal.

%\textit{Note (To be deleted): This section provides a summary of the test your team performed. Give enough information so readers can understand what you did, but do not go into the details of every step.}

\subsection{Pre-Lab Calculations and Schematics}

\medskip

\textit{Note (To be deleted): Include the homework pre-calculations and schematics that serve as the initial setup for the test. Briefly explain the importance of each item you include. You may want to number your equations/figures so you can refer to them in later sections. Including photos of handwritten work is okay.}

\section{Results and Discussion}

Your text here

\medskip

\textit{Note (To be deleted): The heart of your report is the presentation of your results and a discussion of those results. In your discussion, you should not only analyze your results, but also discuss the implications of those results.}

\section{References}

\textit{Note (To be deleted): List any datasheets, websites, lab procedure, etc. used during the lab.}

\section{Conclusion}

Your text here

\medskip

\textit{Note (To be deleted): While the ``Results and Discussion'' section focused on the test results individually, the ``Conclusion'' discusses the results in the context of the entire experiment. Usually, the objectives given in the ``Introduction'' are reviewed to determine whether the experiment succeeded. If the objectives were not met, you should analyze why the results were not as predicted.}

\section{Errors}
